### 1. Introduction
This document provides an overview and documentation of a C program that demonstrates memory allocation and printing of a character array. The program dynamically allocates memory for an array of characters, initializes it with the character 'H', and then prints the content of the allocated memory in hexadecimal format.

### 2. Program Description
The program consists of the following main components:
- `create_array` (not shown in the provided code): This function is responsible for dynamically allocating memory for an array of characters and initializing it with the specified character. The function is not provided in the code, but it is assumed to exist.

- `simple_print_buffer`: This function is used to print the content of a memory buffer in hexadecimal format. It takes two parameters: a pointer to the buffer and the size of the buffer.

- `main`: The `main` function is the program's entry point. It calls the `create_array` function to allocate memory for a character array containing 98 'H' characters. If the memory allocation is successful, it then calls `simple_print_buffer` to print the content of the allocated memory.

### 3. Function Documentation
#### `void simple_print_buffer(char *buffer, unsigned int size)`
This function prints the content of a memory buffer in hexadecimal format.

Parameters:
- `buffer`: A pointer to the memory buffer to be printed.
- `size`: The size of the memory buffer.

#### `int main(void)`
The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It performs the following tasks:
1. Calls `create_array` (not shown in the code) to allocate memory for a character array containing 98 'H' characters.
2. Checks if the memory allocation is successful.
   - If successful, it calls `simple_print_buffer` to print the content of the allocated memory in hexadecimal format.
   - If allocation fails, it prints an error message.

### 4. Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, you can use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-create_array.c -o my_program
./my_program

# malloc
